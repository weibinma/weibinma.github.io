### Weibin Ma's Personal Website
- Why I create this repo:
  - host my personal webpage
  - learn Web development technologies
    - HTML/CSS + JaveScript + Vue 3 + JSON + Go + PostgreSQL

- In-Progress
  - Create a Vue component for each section
    - data is fetched from JSON file for each section
  - Support different resolutions:
    - computer webpage: has a sidebar on the left side
    - mobile webpage: has an expandable menu button to expand covered sections
    - mobile webpage: has a back-to-top arrow


NOTE: I may update the content in free time.
