### Weibin Ma's Personal Website
- Why I create this repo:
  - build & host my personal website
  - learn Web development technologies
    - HTML/CSS + JaveScript + Vue.js + JSON + Go + PostgreSQL, etc.

- In-Progress
  - Create a Vue component for each section
    - data is fetched from local JSON file for each section
  - Support different resolutions:
    - computer webpage: 
      - a sidebar on the left side
    - mobile webpage: 
      - an expandable menu button
      - a back-to-top arrow

- Planning
  - Migrate to Vue CLI


NOTE: I may update the content in free time.
